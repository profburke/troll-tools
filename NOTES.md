Various things to keep track of during development.

- Not quite sure where I'm going with collections vs singletons vs ints. In my Swift Troll
  implementation, everything is a collection. But for now, I think I might have separate ints
  and collections and convert ints into collections (and vice versa for singletons) as needed.

- Going to separate the compiler and vm. But for now, I'm going to be lazy and stick all the files in
  the same directory.
