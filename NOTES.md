Various things to keep track of during development.

- Note: unlike the inspiration (clox from Crafting Interpreters), we want a separate compiler and vm.
  But for now, we'll stuff everything together.

- Not quite sure where I'm going with collections vs singletons vs ints. In my Swift Troll
  implementation, everything is a collection. But for now, I think I might have separate ints
  and collections and convert ints into collections (and vice versa for singletons) as needed.
